How to Code - Simple Data (HtCSD) suffers from a bad naming since instead of
teaching you 'how to code' what it does is
provide a systematic way to reason about, design and structure the individual parts of your program.

HtCSD is the first part of a 2-part course along with How to Code - Complex Data
(HtCCD).

 This course does not require you to
have any prior programming experience but it is recommended that you have worked through the Intro CS
section of the syllabus. HtCSD takes around 7 weeks to
complete.

## Getting Started

{{< tip "warning" >}}
**Free access to HtCSD will expire *seven(7) weeks* after you enroll so do not begin
until you are ready!**
{{< /tip >}}

The course can be accessed from [start page](https://www.edx.org/course/how-to-code-simple-data).
HtCSD is hosted on edX. To get started click on the red button labelled `Enroll`.
If this is the first time you are using this site you will need to create a new
user account before you can begin.

You do not need to purchase this course.
By using the free option certain quizzes will not be available to you. This in
not a problem as those are mostly short review questions that check if you
listened to the lecture. All of the more important exercises along with their
solutions can be found in the `problem bank` linked in the Assignments section
below.

Both HtCSD and the subsequent HtCCD are based on the book [How to Design
Programs (Second Edition)](https://htdp.org/) which can be accessed for free online (just click
on the picture of the book cover). This can be used along with or even instead
of the How to Code courses but is **not required**.

## Course Materials

The various tabs on the course webpage such as `Design Recipes`, `Language`,
`Glossary`, and `Style Rules` contain useful information.

The `Design Recipes` tab of the course webpage contains all the different
'recipes' that will be used for both HtCSD and HtCCD. There is a
[pdf version](https://github.com/AshineFoster/HtDR-book)
made by a third-party to both edX and OSSU.

The `Language` tab give a summary of the syntax rules used for the programming
languages used in the course.

The `Glossary` contains the words used in the course.

The `Style Rules` tab gives a set of convention about how you write code in
the languages used by the courses.
